                            <p>Your free 14-day trial gives you full access to all of the features of your selected Unbounce plan. There are no restrictions, and you have no obligation to continue using Unbounce beyond your trial period. You won’t be billed until after your 14-day trial is complete, and we’ll send an email reminder near the end of your trial to verify that you want to continue using Unbounce. You can cancel at any time by going to “Account Management” in your Unbounce account dashboard, selecting “Subscriptions,” and clicking “Cancel” in the top right corner.</p>

                            <p>We log a conversion when someone completes your assigned conversion goal on a landing page or in a pop-up or sticky bar. Common conversion goals include clicking a call to action button or submitting a form. A visitor is a person who views your landing page, popup, or sticky bar at least once in a given month. Using cookies, we ensure each visitor only counts once toward your limit—no matter how many times they return.</p>
